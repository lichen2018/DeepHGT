# DeepHGT
This project contains codes and data for paper "Deep learning for HGT insertion sites recognition".
## Discription of files
deepHGT.py: a deep residual neural network for HGT insertion sites recognition
deepHGT.h5: the weight of DeepHGT
train_valid_test_data.txt: 1,556,694 sequences for training (90%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) DeepHGT. Half of the data set are near HGT insertion sites and the remaining half are random sequences extracted from the reference genomes.
independent_test_data.txt: 689,332 sequences for testing DeepHGT.
